MVC pattern for Bevy

This is a framework for creating your *View* assuming you *Model* is stored in one or more Bevy `Resource`s. It has been designed with an emphasis on enabling view transitions between states. 
In particular, nodes can be set to linger after being removed so you can design exit transtions for them.
